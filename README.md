# Data-Mining
USC Summer 2021 DSCI 553 (Foundations and Applications of Data Mining) 
### Course Description
Algorithms and techniques of Data Mining and Machine Learning for analyzing massive datasets. Emphasis on Map Reduce and others. Case studies and applications.

Data mining is a fundamental skill for massive data analysis. At a high level, it allows the analyst to discover patterns in data, and transform it into a usable product. The course will teach data mining algorithms for analyzing very large data sets. It will have an applied focus, in that it is meant for preparing students to utilize topics in data mining to solve real world problems.
